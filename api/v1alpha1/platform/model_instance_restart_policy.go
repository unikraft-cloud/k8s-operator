//	The restart policy of an instance.
//
//	When an instance stops either because the application exits or the instance
//	crashes, Unikraft Cloud can auto-restart your instance.  Auto-restarts are
//	performed according to the restart policy configured for a particular
//	instance.
//
//	The policy can have the following values:
//
//	| Policy       | Description |
//	|--------------|-------------|
//	| `never`      | Never restart the instance (default). |
//	| `always`     | Always restart the instance when the stop is initiated from within the instance (i.e., the application exits or the instance crashes). |
//	| `on-failure` | Only restart the instance if it crashes. |
//
//	When an instance stops, the stop reason and the configured restart policy are
//	evaluated to decide if a restart should be performed.  Unikraft Cloud uses an
//	exponential back-off delay (immediate, 5s, 10s, 20s, 40s, ..., 5m) to slow
//	down restarts in tight crash loops. If an instance runs without problems for
//	10s the back-off delay is reset and the restart sequence ends.
//
//	The `restart.attempt` attribute reported in counts the number of restarts
//	performed in the current sequence.  The `restart.next_at` field indicates
//	when the next restart will take place if a back-off delay is in effect.
//
//	A manual start or stop of the instance aborts the restart sequence and resets
//	the back-off delay.
